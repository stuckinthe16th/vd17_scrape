##Note on this page
This page reports the results of the most recent test of the VD17 scrape, finsished at the date and time noted above.  It is only a test of the scraping program, and only reports 100 random results from 3 random years in the seventeenth century.  

If you would like to contribute to this project, or examine the code underlying this scrape, vist the [GitHub page](https://github.com/stuckinthe16th/vd17_scrape) for this project.  The full results of the scrape can be downloaded from [here](http://earlymodernprinting.com/data/test_scrape_results.csv).


##Scrape Report
```{r scrape_report, echo=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(cat(readLines('./test_scrape_output.txt'), sep = '\n'))
```


##Statistics of Results
```{r echo=F,results='asis',error=F,warning=F}
scrape_results <- read.csv("C:/Users/russg/Dropbox (Personal)/R Server Files/vd17_scrape/output/vd17_scrape_2017-06-16.csv")
scrape_years <- unique(scrape_results$year_gb)
scrape_results_stats <-data.frame()
for(x in 1:length(scrape_years)){
     scrape_results_stats <- rbind(scrape_results_stats, data.frame(year=scrape_years[x], num_books= nrow(scrape_results[scrape_results$year_gb==scrape_years[x],])))
     
}

library(knitr)
kable(scrape_results_stats, format="html")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
